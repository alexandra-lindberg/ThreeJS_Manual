# The ThreeJS Playground
Hello developers!\
This demo was bundled using Vite.

I'm going to assume you have nodejs and npm installed.

To run the page locally after cloning the repo simply:
- `cd [path]` to the location of the `main.ts` directory if necessary.
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run dev`

voila!


Thank you for you consideration,\
Alex
